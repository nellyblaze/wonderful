		<h1>A SHORT RUNDOWN OF WHAT I'VE DONE</h1>
	</main>
	<h2>TAGS USAGE</h2>
	<p>I was taught that I could apply audio and visual content to my document there by enriching it with interactive content.
	This below is an audio content of whast I learnt </p>
<audio src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky_-_1812_overture.ogg" controls>a boring song     </audio>
<p> i could as well choose to play the song from another well boring moment that took closer to 2<abbr title="hours">hrs</abbr> </p>
	<audio src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky_-_1812_overture.ogg#t=15:35" controls>a boring song     </audio>
	<p> I did also learn how to incooperate visual but i haven't gotten the appropriate link that would display online</p>

	<p>i was also told how to incooperate links to a different website, like a redirection, but i'll put it when i am requested to do it</p>
	<h2>TABLES USAGE</h2>
	<p> I was taught the use tables to make my work appear neat and accurate as well the utilization of border text, rows and columns    </p>
	<p> For example this is a tabular representation of a time table that I'll never use </p>
	<table border="1">
		<th>MONDAY</th><th>TUESDAY</th><th>WEDNESDAY</th><th>THURSDAY</th><th>FRIDAY</th>
		<tr>
			<td>SLEEP</td><td>EAT</td><td>READ</td><td>PLAY</td><td>TALT WITH MYSELF</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>BAFF</td><td>SLEEP</td><td>WASH</td><td>INSULT MYSELF</td><td>ANALYSE FX</td>	
		</tr>
		<td>STORY OF MY LIFE</td>
	</table>
